/**
 * This class grids and/or samples visibilities to/from UV space.
 * It also executes the FFT(s) required and performs the w-term correction.
 * It does this with the 'w-stacking' method (see Offringa et al., 2013).
 * 
 * This class is quite generic in that it is agnostic to the underlying data format 
 * of the visibilities, and it is written to be of high performance. It is used
 * by the @ref WSMSGridder class to perform inversion and prediction. There, large
 * imaging operations are split up in multiple 'passes' over the data if necessary,
 * and in each pass a few w-layers are gridded/sampled. However, simpler applications
 * might chose not to support this when very large images/large w-terms are not a
 * concern, in which case things become easier.
 * 
 * This class can do both the calculation from visibilities to image, as well as going
 * from (model) image to visibilities. The first is referred to as "Inversion" in this
 * class, and the latter is called "Prediction".
 * 
 * The general call sequence for inversion (/imaging) is as follows:
 * 
 * - Construct an instance with @ref WStackingGridder()
 * - Set settings if necessary (grid mode, denormal phase centre, complex...)
 * - Call @ref PrepareWLayers();
 * - For each pass if multiple passes are necessary (or once otherwise) :
 *   - Call @ref StartInversionPass();
 *   - Add all samples with @ref AddDataSample();
 *   - Call @ref FinishInversionPass();
 * - Finally, call @ref FinalizeImage();
 * - Now, @ref RealImage() and optionally @ref ImaginaryImage() will return the
 *   image(s).
 * 
 * Alternatively, @ref AddData() can be used instead of @ref AddDataSample, to grid
 * several samples that only differ in frequency. To use @ref AddData(), it is necessary to
 * call @ref PrepareBand() first.
 * 
 * For prediction, the sequence is similar:
 * 
 * - Construct an instance with @ref WStackingGridder()
 * - Set settings if necessary
 * - Call @ref PrepareWLayers();
 * - For each pass if multiple passes are necessary (or once otherwise) :
 *   - Call @ref InitializePrediction();
 *   - Call @ref StartPredictionPass();
 *   - Get the predicted visibilities with @ref SampleDataSample();
 * 
 * Similar to Inversion, all values for a band can be predicted at once by calling
 * @ref SampleData() instead of @ref SampleDataSample() when the band has been
 * set beforehand with @ref PrepareBand().
 * 
 * Prediction does not require any finalisation calls.
